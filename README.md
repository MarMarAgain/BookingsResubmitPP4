## Design

### Colour Scheme
The two main colours used are Code Institute red and white.

### Typography
The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, making it both attractive and appropriate.

### Imagery
Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

#### First Time Visitor Goals
- Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath, there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Learn More" Call to Action button.
- The main points are made immediately with the hero image.
- The user has two options: click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which lead to the same place to learn more about the organisation.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
- These are clearly shown in the banner message, directing them to a page with another hero image and call to action.
- The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page, where they can fill out the form or message the organisation on social media.

#### Frequent User Goals
- The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the banner message for newly added challenges or blog posts.
- At the bottom of every page, there is a footer prompting the user to "Subscribe to our Newsletter".

## Further Testing
- The website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.
- The website was viewed on various devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone8, and iPhoneX.
- A large amount of testing was done to ensure all pages were linking correctly.
- Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to identify any bugs or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs
- On some mobile devices, the Hero Image pushes the size of the screen out more than any of the other content on the page, leading to a white gap on the right side of the footer and navigation bar.
- In Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer, all navbar links are pushed upwards when hovered over.
